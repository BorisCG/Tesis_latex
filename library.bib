This chapter describes the direct methods for N-body simulations. Newton's law of gravity imprints its signature on a wide range of scales in the universe, giving rise to a variety of characteristic systems in which the boundary effects are small. Therefore, to a good approximation, the planetary orbits are not affected by the neighboring stars. Likewise, the internal motions of open star clusters are essentially governed by the individual interactions, with the galaxy providing a small external perturbation. The gravitational N-body problem poses a formidable challenge to the numerical analyst. Its nonlinear nature places heavy demands on accuracy considerations, and the need to study large systems over significant times pushes even the biggest computers to their limits. The direct approach is based on the Lagrangian formulation of following the particle motion in detail, as prescribed by Newton's law. Thus, the design of efficient algorithms presupposes some understanding of the problem under consideration, creating a boot-strapping operation. The chapter describes the main computational methods for obtaining direct solutions of the N-body problem and also to be as complete and self-contained as possible.}
